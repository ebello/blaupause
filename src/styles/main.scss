// The `abstracts`-folder gathers SASS tools and helpers used across the project.
// Every global variable, function, mixin and placeholder should be put in here.

// 2. Vendors
// There is two ways to require vendor-files:
// - The `vendors`-folder can contain code from external libraries
// - You can import directly from npm/bower by referencing the approriate path
// If you have to overwrite sections of a vendor-file, use a `vendor-extensions`-folder.
